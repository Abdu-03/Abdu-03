👋 Hello, I'm @Abdu-03.
👀 I have a keen interest in app development and understanding the intricacies of operating systems.
🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my programming skills by learning C through the CS50 course. My next goal is to dive into Python once I'm comfortable with C.
💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on open-source projects, particularly those that focus on education.
📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at amjamal4050@gmail.com or ajdev9090@gmail.com. You can also connect with me on Twitter, my handle is @Light0909090.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I draw inspiration from Markus Persson, the solo developer of Minecraft. It's fascinating to think how a single developer's creation became one of the best-selling video games of all time!
